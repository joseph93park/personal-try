<P>
  Soy bean paste soup is the most common home-cooked dish based on soybean paste.
  <br>  This dish is made with the traditional Korean soybean paste as a base.
<br>Soy bean paste is made by fermenting soybeans and is a nutritionally very healthy food.
<br>People all over the world have the idea that Koreans are skinny.
<br>Since Koreans eat a lot of fermented foods,
they are usually skinny even though they eat a lot of soup.
