        How much do you know about Korea?
        <br>Even 10 years ago, many people had absolutely no information about South Korea.
        <br>However, thanks to many Korean singers and athletes, including BTS in 2021,
        <br>and many modifiers such as the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics, Gangnam Style by PSY,
        <br>and Korea's Corona Virus Prevention,
        the United States now knows a lot about South Korea.

Today is <strong>a food recommendation for <u>future young adults who will visit Korea</u></strong> someday.
